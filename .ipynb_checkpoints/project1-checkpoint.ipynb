    "To summarize.We have a set of hypotesis in this case two.We want to find how accurate they are.

In other word what is the probability of the choosen hypotesis given the data.Ony have to compute one of the probabilities because $P(\\mu_1 | D)=1-P(\\mu_0 | D)$.\n",

    "The calculation is done sequentially.For each iteration we get a new data observation.A new row of genes.We continously update the posterior belief,for all genes,and put the posterior belief of each gene into a list. The belief get updated through calculating the marginal likelihood every time a new row is added and a product is taken between this marginal likelihood and all the presious marginal likelihood calculations bought for $P(  D|\\mu_1)$ and for$P(  D|\\mu_0)$ this is then put into the bayes formula $ P(\\mu | D) = \\frac{P_{\\mu} (D) \\cdot \\xi(\\mu)}{\\sum_{i=1} ^n P_{\\mu_i}(D) \\cdot \\xi(\\mu_i)} $.\n",
