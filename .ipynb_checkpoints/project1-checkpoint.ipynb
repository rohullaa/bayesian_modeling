As described above, we assume a Beta-Bernoulli conjugate prior that leads to a beta distributed posterior belief with parameters $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$.

    "The generate binary_data function gets the inputs :N number columns, num_features of rows and a correlation vector. These numbers are put into NumPy's random.choice functon which creates a matrix with dimensions N x num_features. Each element is eather 0 or one. This matrix is then used to create a correlation between each column in the matrix and the target vector. The target vector is set to be a 0 vector. Each element in the target vector is flipped based on what the value the product between a single feature vector and the random.choice is, which is 1 with p=corr and 0 with p=1-cor. Based on which feature that changes the value of the target to 1, in position i,there is now a correlation between that position in the target vector and feature i. Or = is used because $(1 \\cup 1)=1, \\ \\ (1 \\cup 0)=1,(0 \\cup 1)=1,(0 \\cup 0)=0$. The downside with this procedure is that if one creates correlation between to many features most of the elements in the target becomes 1."
