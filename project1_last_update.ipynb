For each iteration we get a new data observation.A new row of genes.We continously update the posterior belief,for all genes,and put the posterior belief of each gene into a list. The belief get updated through calculating the marginal likelihood every time a new row is added and a product is taken between this marginal likelihood and all the presious marginal likelihood calculations bought for $P(  D|\\mu_1)$ and for$P(  D|\\mu_0)$ this is then put into the bayes formula $ P(\\mu | D) = \\frac{P_{\\mu} (D) \\cdot \\xi(\\mu)}{\\sum_{i=1} ^n P_{\\mu_i}(D) \\cdot \\xi(\\mu_i)} $.\n",
