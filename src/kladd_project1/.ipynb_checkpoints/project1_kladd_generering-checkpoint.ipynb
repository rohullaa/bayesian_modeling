    "## 1a) Bayesian approch\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to predict the effect of genes on symptoms, we will use a simple Bayesian model. We consider these hypothesis:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\mu_0: P(symptoms|genes) = P(symptoms)$$\n",
    "$$\\mu_1: P(symptoms|genes) \\neq P(symptoms)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "In order words, does the genes have any effect on the symptoms or not? If it does, which genomes are the most relevant for the preventing the symptoms? \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "We let Y be the symptoms and our X the genes. Y is an 8 bit vector for each observation,with 1 or zero for each bit. X is an 128 with the same charectaristic as Y.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The probability distribution of $ Y $ depends on an unknown parameter that we assume to be stochastic. We call this unknown parameter $\\theta$ or $ p $. \n",
    "\n",
    "The formulation under is an alternative formulation of the the previous hypotesis. Does the parameter that the probability distribution of Y depend on, depend on X or not. $ \\mu_0 $, our null, says that it does not. $\\mu_1 $, the alternative hypothesis claims it does. We assume the Beta-Bernoulli model:\n",
    " \n",
    "$$\\mu_0: \\theta^0 \\sim Beta(\\alpha^0 , \\beta^0) ,  \\ \\ \\  Y | \\theta^0  $$\n",
    "$$\\mu_1: \\theta^{1,x_t} \\sim Beta(\\alpha^{1,x_t} , \\beta^{1,x_t}) , \\ \\ \\ y_t | x_t \\sim bernoulli(\\theta^{1,x_t}) $$\n",

    "$$ P(\\mu | D) = \\frac{P_{\\mu} (D) \\cdot \\xi(\\mu)}{\\sum_{i=1} ^n P_{\\mu_1}(D) \\cdot \\xi(\\mu_1)} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "We can either set $P(\\mu | D)$ to mean $P(\\mu_1 | D)$ or  $P(\\mu_0 | D)$ depending on which hypothesis we want to check the posterior belief of. \n",
    "\n",
    "We let $P_{\\mu} (D) = P(\\mu |D)$, $D = (x_t, y_t,x_{t-1},y_{t-1})_{t=1} ^T $ for a spesific gene, and let $x_t$ be the value of the gene for observation t (0  or 1), $x_{t-1}$ is a vector of all the previous values of the previous observation up to t-1,  $y_t$ is the the value of symptom Y for observation t (0 or 1),$y_{t-1}$ is a vector of all the previous values of the previous observations including t-1 and $\\mu$ is one of the hypothesis in the set {$\\mu_1$,$\\mu_0$}.  We assume that the different observations(rows) of the data are independent of each other. This gives us:\n",
    "$$ P_{\\mu}(D) = P(y_1,...,y_t \\cup x_1,...,x_t)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ = \\prod_{i=1}^{t} P(y_i | x_i,x_{i-1} , y_{i-1}) $$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "With these assumptions, we can estimate the terms in the $P_{\\mu} (D)$ by \n",
    "$$ P(y_t | x_t,x_{t-1} , y_{t-1}) = \\int_{\\theta} P_{\\theta}(y_t|x_t) \\cdot \\xi(\\theta|x_{t-1},y_{t-1})$$\n",
    "\n",
    "We calculate the likehood of adding a new observation(row) using this formula. It works if we assume that the the next observation is independent from the previous observations.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the marginal likelihood(posterior predictive distribution) which is a compound distribution,which is used to calculate $P(y_t | x_{t},x_{t-1}, y_{t-1})$. The probabilty $P(y_t | x_{t})$ is stochastic in $\\theta$, so we have to integrate over all values of $\\theta$. Every time a new observation is added we calculate $P(y_t | x_{t},x_{t-1}, y_{t-1})$,and recalculate $$ = \\prod_{i=1}^{t} P(y_i | x_i ,x_{i-1}, y_{i-1}) $$. \n",
    "\n",
    "So to calculate $$ P(\\mu | D) = \\frac{P_{\\mu} (D) \\cdot \\xi(\\mu)}{\\sum_{i=1} ^n P_{\\mu_i}(D) \\cdot \\xi(\\mu_i)} $$, we are sequentially updating our belief every time a new observation is added. For every update $\\xi(\\mu)$, $P(\\mu | D)$ is from the previous iteration, exept for the first one. $\\xi(\\mu)$ will cancel because it's constant.\n",
    "\n",
    "This integral simplifies to:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ P(y_t | x_{t},x_{t-1},y^{t-1}) = \\int_{\\theta} P_{\\theta}(y_t) \\cdot d \\xi(\\theta|y^{t-1}) = \\frac{\\alpha_{t,x_t}}{\\alpha_{t,x_t} + \\beta_{t,x_t}}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at $\\mu_1$ we are using the Beta-Bernoulli distribution. Its a binomial distribution where the probability of success at each of n trials is not fixed but comes from a Beta distribution. The Bernoulli distribtuion is a special case of the binomial distribution, where number of trials is equal to 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "We are doing this because our y's are either 1 or 0. It is then reasonable to assume that $Y|X$ is Bernoulli distributed.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is also conviniant because of its conjugate prior property. Now we can calculate $P( D | \\mu_1) = \\prod_{i=1}^{t} P(y_i | x^i ,x^{i-1}, y^{i-1}) $ beacuse we know that the marginal likelihood (posterior predictive dist) is composed of a Bernoulli distribution and a Beta dist $ P(y_t | x^t , y^{t-1}) = \\int_{\\theta} P_{\\theta}(y_t|x_t) \\cdot \\xi(\\theta|x^{t-1},y^{t-1})$, which is beta distributed. For each iteration we end up getting that $P_{\\mu} (D)$ is Beta distributed.\n",
    "\n",
    "The same integral calculation is done for $P(D | \\mu_0)$ but now the marginal likelihood is independent of the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of calculating $P(D |\\mu_1) = \\prod_{i=1}^{t} P(y_i | x_i ,x_{i-1}, y_{i-1})$, we can first calculate $log(P(  D|\\mu_1))$ and then do $e^{log(P(D|\\mu_1))}$,same for $P(D | \\mu_0)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "To summarize, we have a set of hypotesis. In this case two. We want to find how accurate they are, so we have a prior beleif on the strength of the hypothses which we express through a probability. We then want to update our belief of the hypotesis (posterior belief). In other words what is the probability of the choosen hypotesis given the data. We only have to compute one of the probabilities because $P(\\mu_1)= 1 - P(\\mu_0)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The calculation is done sequentially. For each iteration we get a new data observation.A new row of genes.We continously update the posterior belief,for all genes,and put the posterior belief of each gene into a list. The belief get updated through calculating the marginal likelihood every time a new row is added and a product is taken between this marginal likelihood and all the presious marginal likelihood calculations bought for $P(  D|\\mu_1)$ and for$P(  D|\\mu_0)$ this is then put into the bayes formula $ P(\\mu | D) = \\frac{P_{\\mu} (D) \\cdot \\xi(\\mu)}{\\sum_{i=1} ^n P_{\\mu_i}(D) \\cdot \\xi(\\mu_i)} $.\n",
    "\n",
    "We want to find this probability for for each of the genes.This procedure is done for each gene.For each gene if the posterior probabilty is greater then some trechhold we add this gene to the list of important genes that are relvant for explaining that spesific symptom.\n",

Theirfore we assume that these probabilities are beta distributed with the same $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ parameter.To estimate these parameters we firstfind the frequency of people having a certain symptom for both the vaccinated group and the non vaccinated group and devide these frequency by the total number of observation.This is know our estimate of the expected value for r_v and r_n.So we have.\n",

In other words our prior belief is that the random variables r_v and r_n takes a value around 0 with a large probability. The probability of getting a symptom independent of vaccinated or not is very  likely to be around 0. When we get the data we can easly be proven wrong.
