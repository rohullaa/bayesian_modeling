    "In our case our Y is the symptoms and our X is the genes. Y is an 8 bit vector for each observation,with 1 or zero for each bit. X is an 128 with the same charectaristic as Y.\n",

    "The probability distribution of $ Y $ depends on an unknown parameter which also is stocastic. In this case the unknown parameter is $\\theta$ or $ p $. \n",

    "The formulation under is an alternative formulation of the the previous hypotesis.Does the parameter that the probability dist of Y depend on, depend on what the value of X is or not. $ \\mu_0 $ says that it does not.$\\mu_1 $ says it does.\n",

    "where $P_{\\mu} (D) = P(\\mu |D)$, $D = (x_t, y_t,x_{t-1},y_{t-1})_{t=1} ^T $ for a spesific gene, $x_t$ is the value of the gene for observation t ,$x_{t-1}$ is a vector of all the previous  values of the previous observation up to t-1,  $y_t$ is the the value of symptom Y for observation t,$y_{t-1}$ is a vector of all the previous  values of the previous symtoms observation up to t-1 and $\\mu$ is one of the hypothesis in the set {$\\mu_1$,$\\mu_0$}.  We assume that the different observations(rows) of the data are independent of each other. This gives us:\n",

    "We calculate the likehood of adding a new observation(row) using this formula.It works if we assume that the the next observation is independent from the previous observations.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the marginal likelihood(posterior predictive distribution) which is a compound distribution,which is used to calculate $P(y_t | x_{t},x_{t-1}, y_{t-1})$. The probabilty $P(y_t | x_{t})$ is stocatic in $\\theta$,so we have to integrate over all values of $\\theta$. Every time a new observation is added we calculate $P(y_t | x_{t},x_{t-1}, y_{t-1})$,and recalculate $$ = \\prod_{i=1}^{t} P(y_i | x_i ,x_{i-1}, y_{i-1}) $$. \n",
    "\n",
    "So to calculate $$ P(\\mu | D) = \\frac{P_{\\mu} (D) \\cdot \\xi(\\mu)}{\\sum_{i=1} ^n P_{\\mu_i}(D) \\cdot \\xi(\\mu_i)} $$,we are updating our belief,every time a new observation is added,sequentially. For every update $\\xi(\\mu)$ is $P(\\mu | D)$ from the previous iteration,exept the first iteration where $\\xi(\\mu)$ cancels out because it's constant.\n",

    "This integral simplifies to:\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at $\\mu_1$ we are using the beta-binomial distribution.Its a binomial distribution where  the probability of success at each of n trials is not fixed but comes from a beta distribution. The bernulli distribtuion is a special case of the binomial distribution,where number of trials is equal to 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "We are doing this because our y's are either 1 or 0.Then it is reasonable to assume that Y/X is bernulli distributed.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is also conviniant because of its conjugate prior property.Now we can calculate  $P( D/\\mu_1) =\\prod_{i=1}^{t} P(y_i | x^i ,x^{i-1}, y^{i-1}) $ beacuse we know that the marginal likelihood (posterior predictive dist) is composed of a binomial dist times a beta dist $ P(y_t | x^t , y^{t-1}) = \\int_{\\theta} P_{\\theta}(y_t|x_t) \\cdot \\xi(\\theta|x^{t-1},y^{t-1})$,which is beta distributed .For each iteration we end up  getting that $P_{\\mu} (D)$ is beta distributed.\n",
    "\n",
    "The same integral calculation is done for $P(D | \\mu_0)$ but now the marginal likelihood is independent of the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of calculating $P(  D|\\mu_1) =\\prod_{i=1}^{t} P(y_i | x_i ,x_{i-1}, y_{i-1})$ ,we can first calculate $log(P(  D|\\mu_1))$ and then do $e^{log(P(  D|\\mu_1))}$,same for $P(D | \\mu_0)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "To summarize.We have a set of hypotesis in this case two.We want to find how accurate they are. So we have a prior beleif on the strenght of the hypothses which we express through a probability, and we want to update our belief on the strenght of the hypotesis(posterior belief). In other word what is the probability of the choosen hypotesis given the data.Ony have to compute one of the probabilities because $P(\\mu_1 | D)=1-P(\\mu_0 | D)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The calculation is done sequentially.For each iteration we get a new data observation.A new row of genes.We continously update the posterior belief,for all genes,and put the posterior belief of each gene into a list. The belief get updated through calculating the marginal likelihood every time a new row is added and a product is taken between this marginal likelihood and all the presious marginal likelihood calculations bought for $P(  D|\\mu_1)$ and for$P(  D|\\mu_0)$ this is then put into the bayes formula $ P(\\mu | D) = \\frac{P_{\\mu} (D) \\cdot \\xi(\\mu)}{\\sum_{i=1} ^n P_{\\mu_i}(D) \\cdot \\xi(\\mu_i)} $.\n",
    "\n",
    "We want to find this probability for for each of the genes.This procedure is done for each gene.For each gene if the posterior probabilty is greater then some trechhold we add this gene to the list of important genes that are relvant for explaining that spesific symptom.\n",
